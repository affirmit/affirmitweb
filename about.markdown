## About Us

We're a dedicated bunch of developers that like having a good time and good self esteem. One day, when one of us was trying to hang a clock and standing on a toilet hanging a clock, slipped on the wet porcelain and fell and hit our head on the sink. That's when the idea for AffirmIt! came into being.

> "Imagine... A world where we feel good about our code. Where code feels good about itself. Two words: 'group hugs'"..

That -- was the beginning of something great, something truly .... affirming!
